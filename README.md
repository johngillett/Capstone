##Scheduling Freshmen Courses through Simulated Annealing

###Spring 2016

Welcome to our Spring 2016 Capstone Project! This repository contains all the code and relevant files used for our project of scheduling freshmen at the University of Puget Sound into their first-semester schedules. This code is custom-fit from Fall 2015 data, but the overall structure and concepts can be applied in the future for a possible new way of enrolling freshmen into courses.

###Structure of Project
We break the problem up into classes for basic objects, data parsing/generation, scheduling algorithms, and displaying results. These different pieces all come together in the Driver class, which runs the entire scheduling process and outputs a variety of results that summarize our program's success.

###Data Files & Format


###Generating Graphs
To be able to generate graphs summarizing the results of our program, make sure to have JFreeChart installed. Directions on installation can be found at http://www.tutorialspoint.com/jfreechart/jfreechart_installation.htm. If you are using Eclipse to compile and run code, make sure to add the jars to the buildpath of the project as well.
